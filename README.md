video rental store
==================

This is a prototype video rental store that demonstrates



the use of:

Technology stack
----------------

node + express
handlebars
bootstrap
underscore
(mongodb)*


Time constraints limit this prototype to only read operations against two static JSON files.  But in a real development, the interactions (writes and updates) between the client application and the backend would be facilitated through additional HTTP endpoints that would connect to a mongo database.
